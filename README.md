# Melanoma PDX metabolic phenotypes
This repo contains scripts used to generate figures in *Conservation and Divergence of Metabolic Phenotypes between Patient Tumors and their Matched Xenografts* by Rao et al.
Scripts are organized based on the input data:
1. Batch 1 data refers to 18 pairs of patient tumor and early passage PDX metabolomics data.
2. Batch 2 data refers to patient tumor (P0) and serially passaged PDX (P1 to P6) metabolomics data.
3. Tracing refers to [U-13C]glucose isotope tracing data.
4. Pathology folder contains histology analyses comparing PDX and patient tumor.

Each folder contains the data cleaning and organization scripts and the scripts used to generate figures and supplementary tables.
